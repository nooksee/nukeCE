                          respectively. However, if a query result is returned from query cache, the server 
                          increments the Qcache_hits status variable, not Com_select.

                          the indexes you have.

                          </h1>
                          The number of times that a request for a table lock could not be granted immediately 
                          and a wait was needed. If this is high and you have performance problems, you should 
                          first optimize your queries, and then either split your table or tables or use replication.

                          For the memory-mapped implementation of the log that is used by mysqld when it acts as 
                          the transaction coordinator for recovery of internal XA transactions, this variable indicates 
                          the largest number of pages used for the log since the server started.

                          The page size used for the memory-mapped implementation of the XA recovery log. The default 
                          value is determined using getpagesize(). Currently, this variable is unused for the same reasons 
                          as described for Tc_log_max_pages_used.

                          For the memory-mapped implementation of the recovery log, this variable increments each time the 
                          server was not able to commit a transaction and had to wait for a free page in the log. If this value 
                          is large, you might want to increase the log size (with the --log-tc-size option).
